*   How to test fitobs.  *
**************************

You can test different functionalities of fitobs, depending on
different configuration of the option file.

1) Differential corrections: error model (fcct14), AST17 (created with
   DE431 and fcct14), only 6 parameters (initial conditions)

   This is just to check that the software does not change in the six
   dimensional case.
   We use (1862) Apollo without solving for the Yarkovsky effect.

   make test_6dim

2) Yakovsky effect (with both error models: cbm10 and fcct14)

   Decide the error model: cbm10 or fcct14.
   In both cases, the test case is (1862) Apollo
      - If cbm10:
      	a) pay attention that the ephemerides must be the DE405
      	b) go to the directory orbfit/orb43/lib and check that
      	   jpleph --> jpleph.405
      	c) if not:
      	   rm jpleph 
	   and: 
	   ln -s ~/orbfit/jpleph.405 jpleph
 
      	make test_yarko_cbm10

      - If fcct14 run
        make test_yarko_fcct14 (the ephemerides must be DE431)

3) Yarkovsky a priori
   Run:
   make test_apriori

   (410777) 2009 FD is the asteroid used as an example.
   The options are:
   error model = 'fcct14'
   filbe       = 'AST17' (16 perturbers + Pluto)
   a priori    = 0 +/- 32.5 (10^(-15) au/d^2)
 
   All the input files are in the folder 2009FD/.


3) Direct radiation pressure and Yarkovsky effect
   Run:
   make test_drpa2m

   2009 BD is the asteroid used as an example.
   The options are:
   error model = 'fcct14'
   filbe       = 'AST17' (16 perturbers + Pluto)

   All the input files are in the folder 2009BD/
