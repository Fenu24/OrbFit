This User Guide is intended for the competent user who wishes to install the    
JPL ephemerides onto his computer.  We hope that the ephemeris procedure        
described below will be as painless as possible.  A number of people have       
written to say that they have had good success with it.   Certainly, though, we 
shall continue to try to improve it and welcome any suggestions.                
                                                                                
This guide contains the following sections:

    VI. Assistance                                                              
                                                                                
We suggest that you initially read through the whole guide so that you will have
an idea of the overall process.                                                 
                                                                                
It is assumed that you have read the README from this CD.  For the installation 
of the ephemerides, there are two modes:                                        
                                                                                
   1) UNIX users who will use the binary files;                                 
   2) All other users; i.e., those who will convert the ascii files in binary.  
                                                                                
The object is to have a binary file(s), written in the specific binary format of
your computer.  For UNIX users, the binary file(s) on the CD are already in that
format.  For the others, you must convert the ascii blocks into a binary file.  
                                                                                
The blocks cover specific intervals of time.  They may be used separately, or   
they may be merged together into a single large file.                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
====================   II. ASCII to BINARY (for non-UNIX users)   ==============
                                                                                
To convert the ascii blocks into a binary ephemeris, you must first compile and 
run (one-time only) the program "ASC2EPH".  This program accepts, via standard  
input, a header file followed by one or more of the ascii ephemeris blocks.     
Thus, the input is "header.XXX" and (a series of) "ascSYYYY.XXX".  (The "S"     
stands for the "sign": "m" or "p" for "-" or "+"; i.e., "BC" or "AD".  "YYYY" is
the starting year of the block, and "XXX" is the ephemeris number.)  The blocks 
must be in order with no gaps in the intervals of time-coverage.  The binary    
output ephemeris is written onto a file called "JPLEPH".                        
                                                                                
An example for running ASC2EPH on a PC is the following:                        
                                                                                
   C:\> copy header.200+ascp1980.200+ascp2000.200+ascp2020.200  infile.200      
                                                                                
   C:\> ASC2EPH < infile.200                                                    
                                                                                
In UNIX, one would use:                                                         
                                                                                
  cat header.200 ascp1980.200 ascp2000.200 ascp2020.200 ascp2040 | ASC2EPH.e    
                                                                                
Alternatively, you may make an individual binary file for each of the ascii     
blocks, by running "ASC2EPH" separately for each ascii block.  These separate   
binary files may later be merged together by using "binmerge".  This method     
has the advantage of requiring less storage during the creation process, since  
an ascii file requires about three times as much storage as the equivalent      
binary file.                                                                    
                                                                                
                                                                                
====================   III. Testing the Binary File  ===========================
                                                                                
Once you have a binary ephemeris file, you may test it using the program,       
"TESTEPH".  This program computes ephemeris positions and compares the          
results with equivalent values computed at JPL, contained in the file           
"TESTPO.XXX".  So, compile "TESTEPH", assign the name "JPLEPH" to the binary    
ephemeris file that you are testing, and then run "TESTEPH", sending            
"TESTPO.XXX" to the executable via standard input.                              
                                                                                
  The program "TESTEPH" will print out the list of ephemeris constants          
  (retrieved by the subroutine "CONST") and will then use the subroutine        
  "PLEPH" to read and interpolate the ephemeris for coordinates                 
  corresponding to the sample ones in "TESTPO.XXX".  If any comparison          
  yields a difference larger than 10**(-13) [in units of au or au/day],         
  an error message will be printed out.  Further, a line will be printed        
  every 100 comparisons in any case, so that the progress can be monitored.     
                                                                                
                                                                                
====================   IV.  Tailoring the Software   ===========================
                                                                                
     The software was written in standard Fortran-77.  It should work on        
     any machine with a standard compiler.                                      
                                                                                
     HOWEVER, there are two parts which are compiler dependent; both have       
     to do with opening and reading a direct-access file.  They are dealt       
     with in the subroutine FSIZERi, i=1,3.  (There are three versions of       
     this subroutine.)                                                          
                                                                                
     1) The parameter RECL in an OPEN statement is the number of units per      
        record.  For some compilers, it is given in bytes; in some, it is given 
        in single precision words.  Therefore, the parameter NRECL must be set  
        by the user to 4, if RECL is given in bytes; to 1, if RECL is given     
        in words.  (If in doubt, use 4 for UNIX; 1 for VAX and PC)              
                                                                                
     2) Also for an OPEN statement, the program needs to know the exact value   
        of RECL (number of single precision words times NRECL).  Since this     
        varies from one JPL ephemeris to another, RECL must be determined       
        somehow and given to the OPEN statement.  There are three methods,      
        depending upon the compiler.  We have included three versions of the    
        subroutine FSIZER, one for each method.                                 
                                                                                
    ***********************************************************************     
    *                                                                     *     
    *  Therefore, the user must choose which version of FSIZER to use by  *     
    *  un-commenting one of the CALL statements near line 846 in TESTEPH. *     
    *  The user must then set the value of NRECL within that version.     *     
    *                                                                     *     
    ***********************************************************************     
                                                                                
     The following are the three choices of FSIZER:                             
                                                                                
        1)  Use the INQUIRE statement to find the length of the records         
            automatically before opening the file.  This works for VAX's;       
            not in UNIX.                                                        
                                                                                
        2)  Open the file with a value of RECL which is just large enough to    
            enable the reading of the pointers from the first record, use the   
            information from the pointers to determine the exact value of RECL, 
            close the file, and re-open it with the exact value.  This seems to 
            work for UNIX compilers.  (For other compilers, this doesn't work   
            since you can open a file only with the exact value of RECL.)       
                                                                                
        3)  Hardwire the value of RECL.  This number is NRECL*1652 for DE200,   
            NRECL*2036 for DE405, and NRECL*1456 for DE406.                     
                                                                                
    If in doubt, use #1 for a VAX, #2 for UNIX.  The use of #3 is the least     
    desirable, for the subroutine must be changed when a different ephemeris is 
    used.                                                                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
====================   V. Final Product   ======================================
                                                                                
When "TESTEPH" has run successfully, you are done, because "TESTEPH" contains   
and uses the subroutines that are of primary interest to you.                   
                                                                                
   1.  PLEPH reads and interpolates the direct access ephemeris file, and       
                                                                                
   2.  CONST extracts the constants used in making the ephemeris (planetary     
       masses, length of the au, etc.)                                          
                                                                                
These subroutines and three others of interest are described more fully in the  
README.
