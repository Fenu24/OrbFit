==============================  I. Introduction   ==============================
                                                                                
  This CD contains JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides along with associated    
  reading and interpolating routines.  These allow a competent user to obtain   
  the rectangular coordinates of the sun, moon, and nine major planets by means 
  of a subroutine written in standard fortran.                                  
                                                                                
  We suggest for the more casual user, JPL's interactive "telnet" site,         
  "Horizons", which provides a wide variety of astronomical information and     
  which uses the full precision of our ephemerides.  See Section X.             
                                                                                
  The final goal of the installation process is the successful execution of the 
  main program "TESTEPH.F".  This program reads and interpolates planetary and  
  lunar coordinates from a binary direct-read ephemeris file and compares these 
  results against corresponding numbers produced at JPL.  "TESTEPH.F" uses the  
  subroutines which are of eventual interest to the user.                       
                                                                                
  It is strongly suggested that a potential user first read through this README 
  in its entirety.  This will provide an idea of what is involved in both the   
  installation and in the usage of the ephemeris package.

============================   II.  How to Proceed   ===========================
                                                                                
There are two different paths:                                                  
                                                                                
  For UNIX-based users,                                                         
                                                                                
    the actual ephemeris files are available in binary form, ready for immediate
    installation on the user's computer or for use directly from the CD itself. 
                                                                                
  For all NON-UNIX-based users,                                                 
                                                                                
    the ephemeris is supplied in ASCII format and must be converted (a one-time 
    only process) into binary format for installation; software is supplied for 
    this conversion.  (Sorry, we have tried to export binary files for other    
    types of platforms, but the lack of uniformity from one computer and/or     
    compiler to the next made this too difficult.)                              
                                                                                
    Therefore, the non-UNIX-based user, using the program "ASC2EPH", must create
    a binary file by combining the desired choices of "ascSYYYY.XXX" preceded by
    the proper corresponding "HEADER.XXX".                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
  ALL USERS,                                                                    
                                                                                
    must tailor the program "TESTEPH" according to the instructions in          
    "USRGUIDE", paying attention to the parts about "NRECL" and "FSIZER".       
                                                                                
    Run "TESTEPH" as described in "USRGUIDE".                                   
                                                                                
  If "TESTEPH" works, you are done: "TESTEPH" uses the subroutines of interest  
  (which are described in Sections V and VI).

  "USRGUIDE"     : User's Guide containing instructions for obtaining and/or    
                   creating the binary direct-read ephemeris file, tailoring the
                   software, and testing the software package.                  
                                                                                
  "TESTEPH"      : The main program which uses, and therefore tests, the reading
                   and interpolating subroutines.  This program compares the    
                   results with similar runs made at JPL in order to ensure     
                   that the ephemeris is installed and being read correctly.    
                                                                                
                   The reading and interpolating subroutines included in        
                   "TESTEPH", along with the ephemeris file(s) themselves, are  
                   the items which are of eventual interest to the user.        
                                                                                
  "TESTPO.XXX"   : Test results computed at JPL using the ephemeris DEXXX.      
                   These are input by the program "TESTEPH" and are used for    
                   testing the ephemeris installation.  There is a different    
                   "TESTPO" for each different ephemeris; they must match or the
                   test will not work correctly.                                
                                                                                
  "BINMERGE"     : Program to merge two adjoining binary ephemerides.           
                                                                                
  "BINSHORT"     : Program to extract a portion of an ephemeris from a larger   
                   file.                                                        
                                                                                
  for UNIX users

  "unix.XXX"     :  The full binary ephemeris file of JPL Ephemeris DEXXX.      
                    The file may be used straight from the CDrom by the         
                    program "testeph", or it may be copied onto a hard disk.    
                    A shorter-span ephemeris may be extracted from a longer     
                    one using the program, "BINSHORT.F".

  "ASC2EPH.F"    : A one-time conversion program which converts the ephemeris   
                   from ASCII format into binary form (described in "USRGUIDE").
                                                                                
  "ascSYYYY.XXX" : ASCII ephemeris files from JPL Ephemeris DEXXX, covering 20  
                   years, starting in the year SYYYY (where "S" is "m" or "p",  
                   indicating "-" or "+"; i.e., for "BC" or "AD").  The 20-year 
                   blocks may be converted separately into binary ephemeris     
                   files using "ASC2EPH", or they may be combined into a single 
                   ASCII file and then converted into a single binary file.     
                   Subsequently, separate binary files may be merged into a     
                   single ephemeris file using the program, "BINMERGE.F".  Also,
                   a shorter-span ephemeris may be extracted from a longer one  
                   using the program, "BINSHORT.F".                             
                                                                                
  "header.XXX"   : Header info for ephemeris deXXX, needed by "ASC2EPH.F".

     Our latest ephemeris, created in May-June, 1997.  DE405 is based upon the  
     International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), the newly-adopted reference
     frame of the International Astronomical Union (IAU).  The frames of DE200  
     and DE405 differ by no more than about 0.01 arcseconds.

     DE406 is the same ephemeris as DE405, though the accuracy of the interp-   
     olating polynomials has been lessened (interpolation on the 64-day mesh    
     points remains exact, however).  For DE406/LE406, the interpolating        
     accuracy is no worse than 25 meters for any planet and no worse than       
     1 meter for the moon.

=========================  V. Software Description   ===========================
                                                                                
The software package (apart from the programs used to initially construct the   
ephemeris, ASC2EPH, BINMERGE, and BINSHORT) consists of a main test program     
("TESTEPH") which uses the reading and interpolating routines in order to       
retrieve the ephemeris data and to compare the results against the test data.   
                                                                                
Two of the subroutines contained in "TESTEPH" are of primary interest to the    
user: "PLEPH" and "SELCON".  Three others, "CONST", "DPLEPH", and "STATE" may   
also be useful.                                                                 
                                                                                
    PLEPH  :  Get the state vector (position and velocity) of one body with     
              respect to another at any given time within the interval covered  
              by the ephemeris.                                                 
                                                                                
    SELCON :  Retrieve values of user-requested constants on the ephemeris file.
                                                                                
    CONST  :  Retrieve values of all of the constants on the ephemeris file.    
                                                                                
    DPLEPH :  Same as PLEPH, but with increased precision in the input time.    
                                                                                
    STATE  :  Read and interpolate the ephemeris file. (Called by PLEPH).

                    day.                                                        
                                                                                
                    As an alternative, it may prove convenient to set           
                    tdb2(1) equal to some fixed epoch, and set tdb2(2) equal    
                    to the time since that epoch.

There are C-versions of the software, written by outside users.  Access to them 
is described in the file,  "/usr1/ftp/ephem/export/README", on the anonymous ftp
site, "navigator.jpl.nasa.gov"]                                                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
=============  X. Horizons : JPL's Interactive Ephemeris System   ==============
                                                                                
 Horizons, JPL's Interactive Ephemeris System, is now being made available as a 
 WWW site (July, 1997):  http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov                                
                                                                                
 At present, the on-line ephemeris system is a telnet service.  From a telnet-  
 capable machine, telnet to "ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775", where 6775 is a port.  From
 within a web-browser, such as Netscape, type "telnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775". 
 The system will start automatically.  No user-ID or password is required.      
                                                                                
 Reasons for being denied access are:                                           
                                                                                
     1) You typed the wrong machine address or port number.                     
     2) The maximum allowed number of users are already connected.  Try later.  
     3) The system is down (should be rare; 24/7 service is planned)            
                                                                                
 If a user-name/password is requested, you did not specify the port number.     
                                                                                
 The system will automatically negotiate the terminal type.  If this fails      
 (common), the default will be a vt100 display.                                 
                                                                                
 The system will also attempt to determine your window size.  If this fails     
 also common), it will default to a 24 row by 79 column screen display.  If     
 this is inappropriate, and your display paging is choppy, manually set your    
 screen size by using the command "TTY {rows} {columns}", where {rows} and      
 {columns} are replaced by appropriate integers.

====================  XI. Format of the Ephemeris Files   ======================
                                                                                
 It is not necessary to know the information contained in this section in order 
 to install and use the JPL ephemerides.  Some users, however, have requested   
 parts of the following information, so it is provided here.                    
                                                                                
 The first two records of the binary files contain header information; the rest 
 of the records contain the main ephemeris data.  Each ephemeris data record    
 contains a block of 32 days (DE200 and DE405) or of 64 days (DE406) of         
 ephemeris polynomials.                                                         
                                                                                
 For the ascii versions, the main ephemeris data come in 20-year pieces; each   
 piece is composed of a number of 32-day blocks or of 64-day blocks.            
                                                                                
 The first two words in each data record contain the JED of the beginning of the
 data in the block and the JED of the ending of the data in the block.          
 The remaining data are chebychev position coefficients for each component of   
 each body on the tape.  The chebychev coefficients for the planets represent   
 the solar system barycentric positions of the centers of the planetary systems.
                                                                                
 The roadmap to the contents of the 32-day or 64-day blocks is given by         
 "pointers", contained in the first record of the binary files or in the        
 "GROUP 1050" of the ascii headers.  The pointers consist of 3 sets of 13       
 integers each. (In the binary version, the first 12 members of the three sets  
 are stored together; the 13th members of each set are stored later in the      
 record.)  The 13 triplets give information about the location, order and, time-
 coverage of the chebychev polynomials corresponding to the following 13 items: 
                                                                                
       Mercury                                                                  
       Venus

       Mars                                                                     
       Jupiter                                                                  
       Saturn                                                                   
       Uranus                                                                   
       Neptune                                                                  
       Pluto                                                                    
       Moon (geocentric)                                                        
       Sun                                                                      
       Nutations                                                                
       Librations                                                               
                                                                                
 For the ith item, pointer(1,i) is the starting location in each data record of 
 the chebychev coefficients; pointer(2,i) is the number of coefficients per     
 component; pointer(3,i) is the number of complete sets of coefficients in each 
 data record.                                                                   
                                                                                
   For example, the pointers for DE405 look like,                               
                                                                                
     3   171   231   309   342   366   387   405   423   441   753   819   899  
    14    10    13    11     8     7     6     6     6    13    11    10    10  
     4     2     2     1     1     1     1     1     1     8     2     4     4  
                                                                                
   For the moon, starting in the 441st double precision word, there are 13      
   coefficients for the x-coordinate which apply over the first 4 (32/8) days of
   the 32-day interval covered by this block of data.  The next 13 coefficients 
   are for the y-coordinate; then, 13 for z.  Seven similar sets follow for the 
   moon, making 13x3x8=312 words in all.  The coefficients for the Sun follow   
   the moon, starting in the 753rd location.                                    
                                                                                
 There are three cartesian components (x, y, z), for each of the items #1-11;   
 there are two components for the 12th item, nutations : d(psi) and d(epsilon); 
 there are three components for the 13th item, librations : three euler angles. 
 Velocites are obtained by interpolating the position polynomials.              
                                                                                
 Planetary positions are given in kilometers on the file, but are translated    
 automatically into AU's by the software unless overridden by the user.  The    
 nutations and librations are given in radians.                                 
                                                                                
 DE200 is nominally with respect to the mean equator and equinox of J2000,      
 coinciding with the origin of FK5.  DE405 is based upon the Intermational      
 Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), the newly-adopted reference frame of the     
 International Astronomical Union (IAU).  The frames of DE200 and DE405 differ  
 by no more than about 0.01 arcseconds.
