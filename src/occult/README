README file for OrbFit directory "./src/occult"
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a plugin to OrbFit meant to simulate
transits/occultations by disks with arbitrary semiaxes, orientation and
displacement in the orthogonal direction with respect to the star's equator.

The following conventions apply: the unit of length is the star's
radius; the star's cross section is assumed to be the unit radius
circular disk (no limb darkening, althout it could be added easily).
The tranditing disk cross section is described by an ellipse, with
parameters assigned in the occult.opt option file. The unit of time is
1 day, the velocity of the transit is in  (star radius)/day.

The output is in a flat file occultation.fla, it can be processed by
the matlab macro occult.m, providing figures with both the star
luminosity (relative, that is normalized to 1 when no occultation is
taking place) and its time derivative as a function of the time,
restricted to a short timespan around the transit.
