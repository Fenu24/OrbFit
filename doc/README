To learn how to use ORBFIT, you can consult the online help which is
accessible at ./doc/index.html (use any web browser).  Although this
online hypertext manual is still incomplete, it is a useful starting point.

ORBFIT consists of three main prograns: Orbfit, Fitobs, and Bineph.

Orbfit is a batch only, no questions asked program; it can even run
with no input options file, just by giving the asteroid name in the
standard input (but you need to have the files with the data). 

Fitobs is a menu driven, interactive program, which allows a
surprising variety of data processing procedures. Use it on some of
the examples supplied in the ./tests/fitobs directory to learn; use the
online help at each menu.

Bineph is used only to add perturbations from other asteroids to the
dynamic model; to be used only for top accuracy.

To install OrbFit:

1) Download the OrbFit distribution. See README.ftp

2) Unpack and compile. See README.compile

3) Install JPL epehemerides and test the installation. See
   README.tests

After this, OrbFit 2.1.1 is up and ready; you can use it immediately,
by modifying one of the .fop files in ./tests/fitobs and/or one of the
.oop files in ./tests/orbfit.
