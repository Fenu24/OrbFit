"jpleph". The location of the binary JPL ephemerides file is site
dependent. A binary file, but only for LINUX or Windows, can be
downloaded from our site.]

[If you get any error message from the tests, please send a complete
copy of the standard output to some of the members of the ORBFIT
consortium, e.g. milani@dm.unipi.it]

[Now ORBFIT 3.3.1 is up and ready; you can use it immediately, by
modifying one of the .fop files in ./tests/fitobs and/or one of the
.oop files in ./tests/orbfit]
