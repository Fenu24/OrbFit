1. INTRODUCTION</A>
</H1>

<P>
Orbit9 is a software system designed to allow numerical experiments on
orbits of solar system bodies, with different dynamical models. It was
developed starting in 1989 (while I was at Cornell University). Orbit9
is a subsystem designed with user friendlyness as a design parameter,
with the goal of becoming a public domain system.

<P>
The purpose of Orbit9 is to compute the orbits of real solar system
small bodies, within a dynamical model as realistic as possible.  The
program handles a full gravitational N+M bodies problem, with the Sun
and N-1 planets fully interacting between them, and M massless
<I>asteroids</I> attracted by the N mases but not reacting on them.
To compute the orbit of a known asteroid, initial conditions are taken
from a catalogue (e.g. the Ephemerides of Minor Planets, or some other
computer readable catalogue provided e.g. by the Minor Planets
Center); in this case the only thing the user needs to specify to
start the integration is the asteroid number.  However, fictitious
bodies can be handled, provided a suitable initial conditions file is
provided; this input file can be written in a variety of coordinate
systems, provided a header is supplied to explain what is meant.
Unless otherwise requested by the user, all the input and output files
contain a header with all the information needed to understand the
content: e.g. which bodies' orbits are these, the initial epoch, the
starting catalogue, the coordinate systems, etc.

<P>
The output is written in a standard format, but with choice of
reference and coordinate systems.  A separate program (Conv9) allows
to convert the output into a variety of coordinate types, systems,
references, and units, to be later analyzed either by means of GIFFv
or by any program capable of reading a flat file.  The output includes
a sampled time series and a filtered one, with user-specified
decimation.  On request, the maximum Lyapounov exponent can be
estimated -by solving a variational equation- for some of the
asteroids.  The angular variables always include counters for the
number of revolutions, to allow for the determination of frequencies
and/or for the monitoring of critical arguments.  All these features,
however, require some know-how to be used correctly; as an example,
the choice of the sampling and decimation ratios is critical for the
correct working of the output.

<P>
A safety dump feature allows almost always to restart an integration
from where it was interrupted, regardless of whether this was due to a
power failure or to a change of mind on the time span required.  The
computation of an estimate of the maximum Lyapounov exponent can also
be continued in a consistent way.  The accuracy of this continuation
is very good, that is the jump -in both position and velocity-
between the two orbits is at the rounding off level, if the right
options are chosen.  The output format is always compatible with the
input format, but the special dump files have to be used to preserve
full precision of the continuation.

<P>
This program is not meant to handle very unstable cases, which would
require regularisation for close approaches; in practice,
planet-crossing orbits are computed at the user's risk, with all the
orbits integrated numerically with the same stepsize.  The numerical
methods include multistep and symplectic Runge-Kutta; the latter is
generally used only as a starter (being very accurate but very
inefficient).  The program is not meant for dense output (that is, for
a number of output times comparable to, or even larger than, the
number of integration steps).  Many features could be added, but this
would betray the original purpose, which was (and is) the study of the
dynamics of the asteroidal belt.

<P>
Together with Orbit9 the user can also obtain other programs meant to
analyse the output, including the proper elements generation programs
by myself and Z. Knezevic, the Graphic Interactive Fourier Filtering
program (GIFF version v) to perform Fourier analysis and filtering,
the Multiple Trigonometric Analysis Program (MTRAP) by M.  Carpino,
the TeXfor documentation system to print the listing with embedded
T<SMALL>E</SMALL>Xcomments and formulas, and so on.  Everything is
supplied in a self-service mode which allows at least the UNIX users
to compile and run all the programs without any need to go into the
details of the way they have been programmed; for other operating
systems, although all the programs are machine-independent (apart from
graphics), some work is needed to compile and install the software.
Most modules are self explanatory, that is with embedded comments
which should be enough; I cannot guarantee that everything is
understandable and well documented.

<P>
The rest of this  User Guide is organised as follows:

and how.
