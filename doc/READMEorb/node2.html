2. INPUT AND TASK DEFINITION</A>
</H1>

<P>
The user interacts with the program Orbit9 -to define what has to be
done- essentially only by editing the options file <B>orb9.opt</B>.  In
this section we shall comment on that file line by line.  The option
file, as well as other input files, is handled through the utility
routines contained in the file <I>genio.f</I> in such a way that the
input takes the general format:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>variable= value ; comment</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
allowing for comments which in most cases explain all the
available options.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>;input control and options file for Orbit9</TT>
<BR>
<TT>; 1. input file names</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The program needs to find initial conditions both for the planets and
for the massless bodies (``asteroids'') in two files prepared in a
suitable format. The first options are just the names of these files:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>inplan='plan91.inc'; input file for initial conditions of the
planets </TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The planets initial condition files has a single possible format,
regardless of whether the task is to continue a previous integration
or whether the integration starts from a catalogue of osculating
orbital elements.  Thus the periodic dump file, <B>orb9.dmp</B>,
contains the initial conditions for the planets in a format perfectly
suitable to be used as input.  Sample initial conditions files are
provided; they must contain a header, specifying which bodies are in
the file, the reference epoch, the coordinate system, the meaning of
each coordinate, the planetary masses, and the shift with respect to
the reference epoch (in years).  To continue an integration
interrupted for whatever reason, the periodic dump file must be edited
to remove the dumps until the last complete one, renamed (to avoid
conflicts between input and output), and that name must be entered in
the line of <B>orb9.opt</B> shown above; the only option to be changed
is <TT>nout</TT>, with the understanding that the count of the output
records includes the ones already done up to the dump used (warning:
the output files have to be renamed to avoid overwriting; the macro
<I>o9stor</I> is provided to perform this renaming).  The initial
data can be supplied in a variety of coordinate systems; although the
choice for the direct output of Orbit9 is somewhat narrower, by using
the output conversion program Conv9 it is possible to obtain output
with the same choices.  For a complete list of these choices see
section 4.  Nevertheless, the output files different from the dump
files <B>orb9.dmp, orb9.dma</B> should not be used for continuation of a
previous integration, because the rounding off of the formatted output
would result in a significant loss of accuracy in the continuation.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>ibar= 1; barycentric correction 1=yes 0=no</TT>
<BR>
<TT>inbar='barsun91.inc'; file with barycentric correction</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
When the dynamical model of the motion of the asteroids (and of the
planets as well) neglects the perturbation produced by some planets,
the initial conditions have to be corrected to account for the missing
short periodic perturbations.  As an example, the file
<I>barsun99.inc</I> contains the vector from the barycenter of the
inner solar system (Sun and planets up to Mars) to the Sun, in the
system ECLM00, for the same epoch as the initial conditions file; to
perform correctly a computation of the orbits of the outer planets,
and of asteroids perturbed by the outer planets only, this barycentric
vector must be added to the initial heliocentric positions and
velocities of all the bodies; the mass of the inner planets is then
added to the mass of the Sun. Warning: when an integration of the
outer planets is continued from a dump output <B>orb9.dmp</B>, the
barycentric correction is already there, and the masses of the inner
planets are already included in the mass of the Sun (that is, the mass
of the Sun is not 1 in units of the mass of the Sun!), thus the flag
<TT>ibar</TT> has to be set to 0.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>inast='oscel.91'; input file for initial conditions of the
asteroids </TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The asteroids initial condition file can be given in either of two
formats.  The first one is identical to that of the planets, apart
from the fact that the masses are not given; the periodic dump file
<B>orb9.dma</B> is in this format, and can be used for continuation in
the same way discussed above for the planets.  The other format is
automatically used every time the asteroid input file name contains
the string <TT>oscel</TT>; then it is assumed that the input file is a
catalogue given in a format compatible with the computer readable
catalogues distributed by the Minor Planet Center.  An example of the
latter is given in the file <I>oscel.test</I>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The lines of <B>orb9.opt</B> listed above describe the orbit
computation which has to be done, by listing the asteroids (from the
input catalogue specified above) whose orbit has to be computed, and
the ones for which the maximum Lyapounov exponent has to be estimated.
The first <TT>nvz</TT> asteroids in the list are computed with
variational equation, the others without; an empty line terminates the
list.  Warning: if the asteroid initial conditions are read from a MPC
format catalogue, it is assumed that in the catalogue they are listed
in order by number; then it is required that the two sublists, the one
with LCE and the one without, are also odered by number.  This
requirement is not there for the other format, e.g. for continuation
integrations.  Nothing forbids the computation of the orbits of other
asteroids, including fictitious ones; the user must only copy the
input format either from <I>oscel.anyextension</I> or from
<B>orb9.dmp</B>, and give to the file a name either containing, or not
containing, the string <TT>oscel</TT>. By format I do not mean the
exact number of decimal digits, since the Fortran read is done in free
format; I mean the header and the order of the variables.

<TT>nout=  100; output number at job termination</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The output will consist of four files, <B>vast.dat, vpla.dat,
vast.fil, vpla.fil</B>.  They all begin with a header, explaining what is
in the file in exactly the same fomat used in the input files, and
then a time series of orbital elements sampled at regular intervals of
length <TT>dt</TT> (in years), for a total of <TT>nout+1</TT> data points
(including one record containing the initial conditions), for a total
integration time span of <TT>dt*nout</TT> years.  The <B>vast.xxx</B>
files contain asteroid data, the <B>vpla.xxx</B> the corresponding
planet data.  The <B>vxxx.dat</B> files contain data purely sampled,
the <B>vxxx.fil</B> files contain data digitally filtered, then
decimated in such a way that the output interval is still <TT>dt</TT>;
the filtered output is in phase with the sampled one, but there are
two gaps at the beginning and at the end of the integration interval
due to finite filter length.  For details on the filter options, see
below and section 4.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>idump=  10; number of outputs between dump/renormalisation</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Two operations are performed not at every output, but periodically
every <TT>idump</TT> output data points, that is every <TT>dt*idump</TT>
years: dump of the full precision data to allow to restart the
integration (this is done for safety, e.g. as protection against power
failures; under normal job termination conditions, only the last dump
can be useful for continuation), and renormalisation of the
variational vector to avoid overflow problem in strongly chaotic cases
(there is no logical reason for which the periodicity of these two
operations should be the same, I just try to keep the number of
options as low as possible).

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>isamp= 100; sampling ratio of the filter; choose 5, 20, 50 or
100</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The digitally smoothed data are obtained by computing the orbital
elements at a time interval <TT>dt/isamp</TT> and entering them into a
digital filter which outputs them at the interval <TT>dt</TT>; the
output is smoothed in the sense that all the oscillations with periods
between <TT>2*dt/isamp</TT> and <TT>2*dt</TT> are reduced by a large
(typically between 10<SUP>3</SUP> and 10<SUP>4</SUP>) attenuation
factor.  Warning: the choice of the filter input interval
<TT>dt/isamp</TT> is critical in that the oscillations with periods
close to <TT>dt/isamp</TT> can produce long period aliases which might
not be filtered (see section 4).  The example above is adequate for a
computation of the outer planets and of main belt asteroids, since no
large perturbation occurs with period of about 1 year; for a
computation including the orbit of the Earth it would be deadly wrong.
The choice of the sampling ratios <TT>isamp</TT> is limited by the
actual availability of the filter coefficients, which must be in files
with file names <I>filter.dxx</I>; for the format of these files, see
the examples given.  New filters can be designed by the Filgen
software by M. Carpino; however, there is a limit to the filter length
which can be reset by editing the file <I>parfil.h</I>.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>iprqua=    2; how much output: 1 elem. filtr; 2 also sampl.;</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is self explanatory; normally leave 2, unless you want only the
smoothed data and you are running out of disk space.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>sysz= 'HEL' ; output system: BAR, HEL, JAC, HEC</TT>
<BR>
<TT>refz= 'INVL1B' ; output reference system: INVL1B, ECLM50, EQUM00,
etc</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Here we can choose the coordinate system for the output, and the
reference system.  As for the sampled data, the transformation to
whatever coordinate system we want could be done in the output
conversion stage with Conv9; however, for the filtered output, the
two operations of filtering and of changing coordinate system do not
commute, thus it is essential to know in which coordinate system the
output will be used to perform the correct smoothing. On the contrary
the change of reference system is a rotation, a linear operation, and
to do it either before or after filtering does not matter at all. See
section 4 for a description of the options available.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>; 4. options: variational equation</TT>
<BR>
<TT>v1=  1.00d+03; variation vector norm forcing renormalisation</TT>
<BR>
<TT>semim=    3.0; approx. semimajor axis for norm of var.vect.</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
These options pertain to the calculation of the maximum Lyapounov
exponent: the renormalisation is forced whenever the periodic check
(at time intervals  of <TT>dt*idump</TT> years) finds the norm of the
variation vector increased by a factor <TT>v1</TT>; the norm is computed
with a metric defined by <TT>semim</TT>, which should be the approximate
semimajor axis in AU of the asteroid orbit, if you want the orbital
postion and the orbital velocity on a circular orbit both to have norm
1. As a matter of principle, the Lyapounov exponents do not depend
upon the metric; but this is true only at the limit of infinite time,
so it is better to set this at least approximately correct.

<P>

<TT>error= 1.d-13: target error in longitude, </TT><I>rad</I>/<I>rev</I><SUP>2</SUP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The propagator options are quite difficult to select unless the
user has a good understanding of the performance of multistep
and implicit Runge-Kutta integrators. Therefore the program provides for
an automatic choice of the most critical integration parameters, which
is enabled by the flag <TT>iauto</TT>. If the automatic mode is selected,
the program automatically selects the stepsize in such a way that
in all the orbits (planets and asteroids) the truncation error
accumulated in longitude does not exceed <TT>error</TT> radians per
revolution squared; moreover the stepsize is not longer than <TT>h</TT>,
in such a way that the user can force a shorter step. It has to be
taken into account that in the present version (2.1) the prediction
of the integration error is done on the basis of the initial
osculating semimajor axis and eccentricity of each orbit; thus an
orbit which later becomes more eccentric could result in a wrong
predicition, not to speak of an orbit so unstable that the semimajor
axis can significantly change during the integration. In practice the
parameter <TT>error</TT> must be set to a small value, e.g. in the example
given the target is an error less than 0.1 radians after 1 million
revolutions, but not too small because otherwise the rounding off
error might become more important; actually, the program checks the
local ronding off error of your machine and forces <TT>error</TT> to be
not smaller than that. Again, there is no protection against the much
larger errors occuring during fast close approaches; some more reliable
version might appear later.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Apparently, there are many more choices on the propagator, but the
user is warned not to change anything with respect to this example
unless he knows what he is doing. As an example, it might appear a
good idea to increase the order of the multistep and to use longer
steps; unfortunately, there is a stability limit which is not checked
in the present version, and the use of <TT>iord</TT> larger than 12 is
likely to result in such an instability; for a discussion of all the
theory, the user should consult Milani and Nobili, <I>Celestial
Mechanics <B>43</B></I>, 1-34, 1988, taking into account that the
algorithm used here is backward difference, second sum, of order
<TT>iord</TT>. All the other options pertain to the starter or even to
not yet implemented features.
