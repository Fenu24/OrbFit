<P>
The input initial conditions are read and transformed into the
integration coordinates, which are barycentric cartesian coordinates;
this is done in the routines contained in the file <I>input9.f</I>.
The output files are initialised by writing a header, then by writing
the initial conditions as transformed in the output coordinate system;
after some initialisations, the main program (see the file
<I>orbit9.f</I>) goes into the main loop, propagating the state vector
until the next filter input time; the output data are filtered,
and when the filter output is ready it is written in the filtered
output files; the sampled data are written in a way which appears
asyncronous in the program, but which exactly compensates for the
filter startup delay in such a way that the two time series are in
phase. Periodically the state vector is dumped to allow for restart
without significant loss of precision.

<P>
All the above is quite straightforward, possibly the most complicated
pieces of software being the coordinate change library (contained in
<I>coord.f</I>), apart from the propagator which is anyway well
isolated and can be considered as a black box.  Let us now discuss
some special features of this program: the handling of angle variables
and the variational equations.

<P>
As for angle variables, let us take as an example the coordinate types
EQU, that is equinoctal elements, which is always used in output from
Orbit9 (The other case, Keplerian elements, can be produced by
Conv9, see section 4).  The last coordinate is the mean longitude
<IMG

 ALT="$\lambda$">,
and it is always written as a principal value (between 0and <IMG
 WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$2\pi$">)
plus a number of revolutions.  The number of revolutions
at the initial time is always given in input (it is assumed to be zero
in the catalogue input case), and the count of the number of
revolutions is kept up to date; this is true both for the sampled and
the filtered output.  This is achieved by exploting a 2-body
approximation, that is the number of revolutions is predicted at each
filter input by using the mean motion and corrected at most by one;
the filter preserves the linear trend of the angular variables
(because the filter coefficients have sum exactly 1 and are
symmetric) and removes the superimposed short periodic oscillations.
Strongly unstable orbits (e.g. undergoing temporary satellite capture,
and/or very close approaches) can however result in a cycle slip; in
this case, the filtered output shows the filter response to a step
function, which is a diffraction pattern; these cases have to be
interpreted with some caution (see the Ramos documentation).

<P>
The estimation of the maximum Lyapounov Characteristic Exponent is
performed by solving the linearized equations of displacement for a
single variation vector.  Whenever a new LCE estimation is requested,
a variation vector with random components and unitary norm is used as
initial condition.  The output then contains a column with, for each
asteroid, the natural logarithm of the current norm of the vector
solution of the variational equation (the norm is controlled by the
input parameter <TT>semim</TT>); if the variational equation is not
being computed for some asteroid, this column contains a zero.  The
maximum LCE can be estimated (actually, this is an upper bound) by a
linear fit to this quantity.  However, the variation vector is
renormalised to avoid possible overflow if the integration interval is
much longer than the inverse of the maximum LCE; this is totally
transparent in the output, although the operation performed is quite
complex, involving the use of the starter (because the state vector,
including the variation vector, has a discontinuity).

<P>
These two features require some quirky code to handle the case in
which the integration is restarted from some dump.  If everything is
continued without any change of parameters (the only option changed in
<B>orb9.opt</B> is <TT>nout</TT>) the revolution count and the LCE
estimation are just continued.  On the contrary there are some tricky
cases when something has been changed, e.g. the list of asteroids for
which the LCE has to be estimated (this would occur if the list of
asteroids required, as given in <B>orb9.opt</B>, was reordered).  If
the LCE requested in a continuation integration is a new one, then the
variation vector is initialised in a random way with norm 1.  If
continuation occurs starting not from the dump file, but from some
other output file, then some strange computations have to be done to
make sure that the revolution counters are reinitialised properly.
Hopefully, all this will work automatically and it is difficult to
make a mistake which actually results in a wrong output.

<P>
The propagator-interpolator is described elsewhere (e.g. <I>Orbit4
mathematical specifications</I>, Milani 1992, Milani and Nobili
1988); in essence, it contains a symplectic single step method
(implicit Runge-Kutta-Gauss) and a multistep predictor/corrector.
The output data are not really interpolated: if the output time is not
a multiple of the stepsize, a short step is performed with the
signle-step method. Thus the filter input interval <TT>dt/isamp</TT>
should be a multiple of <TT>h</TT> for optimum performance, and an
interpolator should be added for dense output; if the automatic
selection of the stepsize is enabled, <TT>h</TT> is automatically
selected as a submultiple of the filter input interval.
This version (see <I>propin9.f</I>) has anyway to be considered a temporary one, to be
replaced by a more user friendly and reliable one.
