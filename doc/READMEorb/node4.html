4. OUTPUT</A>
</H1>

<P>
The main choices involved in the design of the output are: the
coodinate type, system, and reference; the filter decimation; and the
most critical parameter of them all, the quantity of output.

<P>
The choices of coordynate types and systems are described in the
comment on top of <I>coord.f</I>; at present, you can get output in
cartesian coordinates (CAR), keplerian elements (KEP) and equinoctal
non singular elements (EQU), the latter as defined by Broucke and
Cefola (1982).  Parabolic and hyperbolic elements are not currently
supported.  To add a new option, modify <TT>coocha</TT> in <I>coord.f</I>.  The coordynate systems available are currently
heliocentric (HEL), jacobian (JAC), barycentric (BAR) and heliocentric
canonical (HEC).  The reference systems are mean ecliptic of B1950.0
(ECLM50), mean equator of B1950.0 (EQUM50), mean equator of J2000.0
(EQUM00), mean ecliptic of J2000.0 (ECLM00), invariable plane of the
outer solar system according to LONGSTOP 1B (INVL1B); in the first
four cases, the x axis is defined by the corresponding mean gamma
point.  New reference systems can be added by modifying <TT>refer</TT> in
<I>coord.f</I>.  There is also a choice for the units to be used for
the angle variables, between radiants (RAD), degrees (DEG) and
revolutions (REV).  Warning: these units also apply to the inclination
in keplerian variables, although the inclination is not an angle
variable.

<P>
Not all these choices are available directly in the orbit9 output,
which is always EQU RAD; the output has to be converted by running
Conv9.  The options for Conv9 can be provided in the file
<B>conv9.inp</B>, as well as interactively; the result is always a
number of files, each containing the data on a single orbit, with or
without header, and in the required coordynate system, reference
system, etc.

<P>
On the contrary, digital filtering has to be performed on line,
because post-filtering of the output (e.g. from within Giffv) does not
produce the same effect.  To understand this fully, you should read
the filtering manual which is in the <I>doc</I> directory and/or
Carpino, Milani and Nobili (1987).  In short, the filter is capable of
removing the oscillations with periods between <TT>2*dt/isamp</TT> and
<TT>2*dt</TT>, but may not remove the ones with periods shorter than
<TT>2*dt/isamp</TT>; some of these, as a result of sampling with
interval <TT>dt/isamp</TT>, can generate aliases with comparatively
long periods, which could well escape the filtering.  To make all this
understandable by the novice user, let us take an example: suppose
that <TT>dt=100</TT> and <TT>isamp=100</TT>; then an oscillation with
a period of 1.001 years, sampled at 1 year interval, will appear at
the filter input as an oscillation with a period of 1,000 years, and
it will be preserved in the output.  To correctly filter out the short
period effects, we need on the contrary to make sure that no
significant effect occurs with a period shorter than 2 years, or at
least not with periods close to 1 year, 1/2 year, 1/3 year, etc.

<P>
Another pitifall of digital filtering is avoided by remembering that
any nonlinear transformation changes the spectrum of a function; as a
simple example, if the equinoctal variables <Tt>h,k</TT> contain 
the frequencies 
<!-- MATH: $g_5, g_6, g_7\ldots$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$g_5, g_6, g_7\ldots$">,
the eccentricity 
<!-- MATH: $e=\sqrt{h^2+k^2}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$e=\sqrt{h^2+k^2}$">contains the difference frequencies 
<!-- MATH: $g_5-g_6, g_5-g_7, g_6-g_7\ldots$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$g_5-g_6, g_5-g_7, g_6-g_7\ldots$">.
As long as all these are slow frequencyes, there is no problem;
however, the difference of two fast frequencies can be a slow
frequency, thus filtering <TT>e</TT> and filtering <TT>h.k</TT> does
not give the same result; in orbit9 the filter is always applied to
the equinoctal elements.  Another example of this can be obtained by
filtering the orbital elements in jacobian coordinates, then
converting them to heliocentric coordinates: in the filtered jacobian
output the short periodic perturbations are removed, but in the
heliocentric transformation they appear again, because it is the
transformation between jacobian and heliocentric coordinates which
contains most of the short periodic effects (mostly through the motion
of the Sun).

<P>
Thus you need to decide before performing a long integration which
coordinate system is going to be used in the analysis of the output,
which is the range of short periodic perturbations which you want to
remove by filtering, and which is the band of interest, that is, which
frequencies have to be preserved.  This is needed not only for the
filter, but also for the determination of frequencies and to maintain
the revolution counters.  As an example, if the output is transformed
in keplerian coordinates, the number of revolutions of the perihelion
and of the node can be computed correctly if and only if these two
angles never change by more than <IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\pi$">
in the interval <TT>dt</TT>.  If
this is done correctly, then the frequency of the perihelion can be
obtained by a linear fit (a menu choice in GIFFv); otherwise there
could be a significant problem in reconstructing the frequency.  Thus
the filter output interval must be longer than the longest short
period to be removed and shorter than half the shortest long period to
be studied.  As an example, <TT>isamp=50</TT> and <TT>dt=50</TT> is good 
for the orbit of a Trojan asteroid computed without the inner planets 
(but do not forget the barycentric correction!) because the oscillations
with period close to the libration period (
<!-- MATH: $\simeq 150$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\simeq 150$">
years) are
preserved and the short periodic perturbations with periods of the
order of 1 year are negligible. However, the other constraint, that is
the size of the output, has to be taken into account, since an
integration for 1 million years with the above parameters results in
20,001 output data points and roughly 4 Megabytes per asteroid.

<P>
In practice, not even I am able to make all these choices right at the
first attempt; given a dynamical problem, some test integrations and
their analysis (e.g. with GIFFv) are required to understand the basic
spectrum and to choose the parameters for a longer integration.
