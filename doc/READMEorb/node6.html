<P>
2. This software has been developed by A. Milani, who has in turn
incorporated some free software developed by other people, mostly by
M. Carpino (Astronomical Observatory, Milano/Brera). The author cannot
take any responsability for the performance of this software, nor for
its upgrade; the software maintenance of these codes must result from
the collaboration of the users, who are kindly requested to report any
error and/or limitation not already described here.

<P>
3.  This software can be modified by the users at their own risk.  The
best effort has been done to make this not too difficult.  I give here
an example: suppose you want to manufacture a program to compute the
orbits of the satellites of Saturn.  Then you should 1) modify the
right hand side of the differenctial equations (file <I>fct9.f</I>)
to add the zonal harmonics of Saturn gravitational field; the latter
will depend upon some parameters, called e.g. <TT>pj2, pj4</TT>. 2)
modify the common contained in <I>commas.h</I> by adding <TT>pj2,
pj4</TT>. 3) modify the routines <TT>reamas, wrimas</TT> in such a way that
they also handle <TT>pj2, pj4</TT> in input and output; there you can
also change the choice of the units, by replacing Gauss constant <TT>gk</TT> with something else. 4) add new options to <TT>refer</TT> in <I>coord.f</I> to be able to refer the results to the planet's equatorial
plane. 5) prepare suitable initial conditions files, in which the so
called planets file will contain also the initial conditions for the
more massive satellites, the so called asteroid file will contain the
initial conditions for the small satellites; the inverse mass of
Saturn must replace the inverse mass of the Sun, and the mass of the
Sun will appear as the mass of a perturbing body.  All this might
appear complicated, but starting from scratch and writing all your own
software is more complicated (although it is an instructive exercice).
