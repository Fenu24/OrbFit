<B> OrbFit has undergone two major upgrades. </B>

Starting from version 3.0 it has been written in a different language,
namely Fortran90/95. The change does not only involve the free format
of the source code: the new versions deeply exploit the main features
of Fortran90, especially user defined data types and modules.
<P>

OrbFit has recently exceeded the 160,000 lines of Fortran95. Also for
this reason, it has been necessary to split the global system into
<B> three subsets </B>.

<UL>
<LI> The <B> Distribution </B> is free
software, available under GPL; it contains the libraries, and the
executable programs <B>fitobs</B>, <B> catpro</B> and
<B>orbfit</B>. This portion provides the main algorithms for orbit propagation, ephemerides
computation, orbit determination, close approach analysis, and impact
monitoring. Starting from version 4.0, the OrbFit distribution also
includes the software previously distributed as ORBIT9. The <B> ORBIT9
</B> software system used to be a plug in of the Fortran77 version of
OrbFit, and has been maintained as standalone free software. It has
now been converted to Fortran95 and has been included in the
distribution, thus making maintenance and upgrades easier. ORBIT9
provides long term orbit propagation for asteroids and other solar
system bodies, computation of Lyapounov exponents, computation of
proper elements, both analytic and synthetic, and a Graphics
Interactive Fourier Filtering program for displaying the results. <a
href="/orbfit/OrbFit4.0.tar.gz"> The OrbFit distribution for UNIX,
</a> including ORBIT9, amounts to about 86,000 lines of source
code.

<LI> The <B> OrbFit Server Suite </B> is a set of programs combining
the OrbFit basic algorithms, as well as new and experimental ones, to
provide the functionalities needed by a solar system survey to compile
a catalog of orbits for the discovered objects. It is not free
software, although it is not commercial either: it is distributed
under a special <a href="license.pdf"> Scienceware License </a>, by
which the user are obliged to credit the use of the software in
whatever publication using its results. One main feature is the use of
the <a href="PS_DES_v2.02.pdf"> Data Exchange Standard </a>, developed
originally for the projects Pan-STARRS and LSST, but now more widely
used, to exchange data relevant for population orbit determination.
This portion is about 18,500 lines of source code.

<LI> There is a <B> non-distribution </B> part of OrbFit, containing
the software specifically used to maintain the online information
systems <a href="http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys"> NEODyS </a> and <a
href="http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/astdys"> AstDyS </a> and also for
our research on different topics, such as asteroid identification,
proper elements for NEA, MOID computation, space debris orbit
determination, and so on. Some of this software is transferred to the
distribution part as the research is concluded and published. Other parts
are specifically connected to some of our long term research programs
and thus will not be distributed for now.

<B>Requirements</B></FONT></TD> <TD WIDTH=60%> The software we are
providing has been developed under LINUX and is distributed in a
package allowing for automatic compilation on whatever target computer
with a LINUX operating system; compilation is possible under the free
Fortran95 compiler gfortran, although we also use the commercial
compilers Intel and Lahey. Installation under some other dialect of
UNIX should be straightforward for an expert user.  We are sorry, but
we are currently not equipped for distributing OrbFit in a Windows
version; more exactly, we do not want to be equipped, by paying a tax
to Microsoft to be allowed to provide free software.  </TD> <TD

<TD WIDTH=60%> You can use the online help <a
href="./OrbFit/doc/help.html"> here</a>, but this document needs to be
updated. You may also go directly to our online OrbFit <a
href="OrbFit/"> distribution directory</a>. After compiling the code,
you can access the OrbFit main programs through the OrbFitSoft
graphical interface, available in the ./doc directory. <P>

We have abandoned the original idea of writing a mathematical
specification document for OrbFit, because it would be huge and hard
to maintain, even assuming we had the time of writing it, which has
not been the case so far. However, we have written a textbook
<B> The Theory of Orbit Determination </B>, by A. Milani and
G.F. Gronchi, to be published soon by Cambridge University Press <a
href="../orbdet/orbdet_index.pdf"> (index of this book)</a>. The
content of this book covers most of the subjects which are needed to
understand the working of OrbFit. (The former ORBIT9 software would
require a separate textbook, which is being planned.) The copyright
for this book has been given to the publisher, thus we cannot make the
full text available on the web: we intend to publish appendixes,
comments, errata corrige, and other related material on this site <a
href="../orbdet/"> here.</a> </TD>
